## 1 What is Fate Hybrid Skills?
Fate Hybrid Skills is a FoundryVTT module which adds support to the [Fate Core Official](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fate-core-official) package for FoundryVTT.  It is based on the article [What You Do and How You Do It: Merging Fate Core and Accelerated](https://fate-srd.com/fate-codex/what-you-do-and-how-you-do-it-merging-fate-core-and-accelerated) by Alexandre Malette, from "Fate Codex, Volume 3,  Issue 2", and on the blog post entitled [Two Column Fate](https://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2014/03/12/two-column-fate/) by Rob Donoghue.

This module allows you to add a second skill column to your sheet--usually Approaches. Whenever you attempt to roll a skill, you select the accompanying skill from the left column before rolling with the right.  Game Masters are encouraged to read the Fate Codex article and blog post, referenced above, in order to understand the implications of having two skill columns on their player's sheets.

## 2 System Settings
When you first enable the Fate Hybrid Skills module, it will be a blank slate. To get it ready for play, you'll need to set it up in the Foundry system settings.

**If you don't set these up before you create any characters, the characters you create will not be initialised with any approaches.**

Here are what the various settings do:

### Setup Approaches
You can edit, delete, or copy existing approaches in your world, or create new approaches here. When you first create a new world, this list will be empty. You can start setting up your own approach list here and now, or you can use the "Replace or clear all World Approaches" option to set your world up with one of the default sets from Accelerated or Dresden Files Accelerated.

If you click "Add a new Approach", a window will pop up with a box for each piece of information about the approach. Most of these will be self-explanatory.

If you click the "PC Approach" check box, this skill will be assigned to all characters upon creation. Otherwise, it will only be available for you to add to characters from each character's approach editor window.

To save your new (or edited) approach, hit 'Save Changes'.

### Replace Or Clear All World Approaches
Pick a list to initialise your world with; Fate Accelerated or Dresden Files Accelerated. This will set the defaults for any new characters created but will not affect existing characters. The initialising will occur when you click the 'save changes' button.

## Character Sheet
When you create a character, it will be initialised with a set of all PC Approaches at Mediocre (+0).

The approaches allocated to a character are a local copy. If you go back in and edit the system versions of these, it will NOT change any existing characters. If you make a change to a system setting for an approach that you want to be reflected on a character, just delete and re-add the relevant approach and it will be updated.

### Approach Editor
You can sort the approaches here by name or by rank by clicking on the sort button at the bottom. You can do this while you're filling out the approaches to check whether they are in a valid formation (e.g. 1 Great, 2 good, 3 fair, 4 average). When you hit Save, the approaches will be committed to the character.

GMs, you can click the edit button at the bottom of this window to add or remove approaches from a specific character or to add an ad-hoc approach that's unique to this character. You can also add approaches you set up without the PC checkbox ticked here.

To add an ad-hoc approach, just type the name in the box at the bottom of the screen and click the plus button.

### Approach List
You can right click an approach name to view the information entered by the GM for that approach.
Click the sort button to switch between sorting by rank or by name.
Click anywhere between the approach name and the radio box to select that approach; it will be added to your total when you roll a skill.
Click the cog icon to open the approach editor.
